# Dynamic Memory Mapped Queue

Three simple queue implementations

### Description

This repository is a queue program designed to compare run-times of various queue implementations. The
makefile provides functionality to compile the multi-build project into a single distributable and also test.

Many of the files contained in this repository also fulfill some of the requirements for the BYU course titled CS 324.
It is written and maintained by Scott Leland Crossen.

### Copyright & Plagiarism Notes

1. **General:** As shown in the attached license, I yield any rights that I posses related to this project in regards to
copyright or anti-plagiarism law enforcement as long as my full name is attributed to somewhere in the code-base or credits
screen and the terms of the license agreement are propagated in the resulting code. I am absolutely fine with businesses
or students using this -- or part of this -- code under these conditions.

2. **BYU:** This project fulfills course requirements for one or more classes at BYU. After reviewing BYU's honor code
thoroughly (an act prompted by a vindictive professor who apparently hasn't read the honor code himself), I have learned
that the only restriction on sharing my code online is if I have the intention of providing "unfair advantage over other
students" or if I intentionally plan to "commit acts of academic dishonesty". Because I do not have any such intentions
(I am sharing this with the general public for the purpose of the open source community and it's ideals), any subsequent
actions taken by others resembling cheating or gaining an unfair advantage in their school work would be coincidental
and not related to me in any way. I will not knowingly assist other students with their coursework nor will I accept
responsibility for their actions given that the terms of the attached license are correctly observed.

3. **Students:** If you are a student then please note that it appears that there is nothing wrong with including others'
work as long as you adhere to the terms of their license or copyright. If this were not the case then students could not
program in any language besides basic machine code - because any higher abstraction would arguably be using work completed
by other people. You may want to check your university's academic policy, but I believe you should be free to use this
repository in your work. Recall however, that I dissociate myself of any of your actions and will not knowingly assist
(or litigate for that matter) anyone with such intentions given that the terms of this license are adhered to.

4. **Professors:** If you are a professor that takes issue with the public nature of this repository then I would like
to hear from you. Please contact me at my public email address listed on GitHub and be sure to include: (1) your contact
information, (2) the clause in the honor code or university policy that I am breaking, and (3) any other information that
shows that academic dishonesty has occurred such as unattributed source code. I respect all the professors that I have
worked with in my academic career and would be fine with removing this repository from my public-facing account given a
respectful request (please do not threaten me as other professors have done). I hope however, that you will learn something
from these notes about how the software community works and what allegations you as a professor are allowed to make
related to academic dishonesty. That said, Iâ€™m usually very cooperative.
