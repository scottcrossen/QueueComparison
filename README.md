# Dynamic Memory Mapped Queue

Three simple queue implementations

### Description

This repository is a queue program designed to compare run-times of various queue implementations. The
makefile provides functionality to compile the multi-build project into a single distributable and also test. A docker-build system is included for cross-platform development and isolation. It also faciliates the rebuilding process whenever a change is made to source files.

It is written and maintained by Scott Leland Crossen.
